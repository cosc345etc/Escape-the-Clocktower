al_get_fs_entry_name \- Allegro 5 API
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#include\ <allegro5/allegro.h>

const\ char\ *al_get_fs_entry_name(ALLEGRO_FS_ENTRY\ *e)
\f[]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Returns the entry\[aq]s filename path.
Note that the filesystem encoding may not be known and the conversion to
UTF\-8 could in very rare cases cause this to return an invalid path.
Therefore it\[aq]s always safest to access the file over its
ALLEGRO_FS_ENTRY(3) and not the path.
.PP
On success returns a read only string which you must not modify or
destroy.
Returns NULL on failure.
.RS
.PP
Note: prior to 5.1.5 it was written: "...
the path will not be an absolute path if the entry wasn\[aq]t created
from an absolute path".
This is no longer true.
