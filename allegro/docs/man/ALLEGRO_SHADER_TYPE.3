.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Used with al_attach_shader_source(3) and al_attach_shader_source_file(3)
to specify how to interpret the attached source.
.TP
.B ALLEGRO_VERTEX_SHADER
A vertex shader is executed for each vertex it is used with.
The program will output exactly one vertex at a time.
.RS
.PP
When Allegro\[aq]s graphics are being used then in addition to all
vertices of primitives from the primitives addon, each drawn bitmap also
consists of four vertices.
.RE
.TP
.B ALLEGRO_PIXEL_SHADER
A pixel shader is executed for each pixel it is used with.
The program will output exactly one pixel at a time \- either in the
backbuffer or in the current target bitmap.
.RS
.PP
With Allegro\[aq]s builtin graphics this means the shader is for example
called for each destination pixel of the output of an al_draw_bitmap(3)
call.
.PP
A more accurate term for pixel shader would be fragment shader since one
final pixel in the target bitmap is not necessarily composed of only a
single output but of multiple fragments (for example when
multi\-sampling is being used).
