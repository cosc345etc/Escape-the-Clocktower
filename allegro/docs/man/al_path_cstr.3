.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Convert a path to its string representation, i.e.
optional drive, followed by directory components separated by
\[aq]delim\[aq], followed by an optional filename.
.PP
To use the current native path separator, use ALLEGRO_NATIVE_PATH_SEP
for \[aq]delim\[aq].
.PP
The returned pointer is valid only until the path is modified in any
way, or until the path is destroyed.
This returns a null\-terminated string.
If you need an ALLEGRO_USTR instead, use al_path_ustr(3).
