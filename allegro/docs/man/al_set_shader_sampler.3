.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Sets a texture sampler uniform and texture unit of the current target
bitmap\[aq]s shader.
The given bitmap must be a video bitmap.
.PP
Different samplers should use different units.
The bitmap passed to Allegro\[aq]s drawing functions uses the 0th unit,
so if you\[aq]re planning on using the \f[C]al_tex\f[] variable in your
pixel shader as well as another sampler, set the other sampler to use a
unit different from 0.
With the primitives addon, it is possible to free up the 0th unit by
passing \f[C]NULL\f[] as the texture argument to the relevant drawing
functions.
In this case, you may set a sampler to use the 0th unit and thus not use
\f[C]al_tex\f[] (the \f[C]al_use_tex\f[] variable will be set to
\f[C]false\f[]).
.PP
Returns true on success.
Otherwise returns false, e.g.
if the uniform by that name does not exist in the shader.
