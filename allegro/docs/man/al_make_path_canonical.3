.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Removes any leading \[aq]..\[aq] directory components in absolute paths.
Removes all \[aq].\[aq] directory components.
.PP
Note that this does \f[I]not\f[] collapse "x/../y" sections into "y".
This is by design.
If "/foo" on your system is a symlink to "/bar/baz", then "/foo/../quux"
is actually "/bar/quux", not "/quux" as a naive removal of ".."
components would give you.
