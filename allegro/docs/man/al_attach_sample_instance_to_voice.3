.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Attaches a sample instance to a voice, and allows it to play.
The instance\[aq]s gain and loop mode will be ignored, and it must have
the same frequency, channel configuration and depth (including
signed\-ness) as the voice.
This function may fail if the selected driver doesn\[aq]t support
preloading sample data.
.PP
At this time, we don\[aq]t recommend attaching sample instances directly
to voices.
Use a mixer inbetween.
.PP
Returns true on success, false on failure.
