.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Loads an image from an ALLEGRO_FILE(3) stream into a new
ALLEGRO_BITMAP(3).
The file type is determined by the passed \[aq]ident\[aq] parameter,
which is a file name extension including the leading dot.
If (and only if) \[aq]ident\[aq] is NULL, the file type is determined
with al_identify_bitmap_f(3) instead.
.PP
The flags parameter is the same as for al_load_bitmap_flags(3).
.PP
Returns NULL on error.
The file remains open afterwards.
