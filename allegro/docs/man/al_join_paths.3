.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Concatenate two path structures.
The first path structure is modified.
If \[aq]tail\[aq] is an absolute path, this function does nothing.
.PP
If \[aq]tail\[aq] is a relative path, all of its directory components
will be appended to \[aq]path\[aq].
tail\[aq]s filename will also overwrite path\[aq]s filename, even if it
is just the empty string.
.PP
Tail\[aq]s drive is ignored.
.PP
Returns true if \[aq]tail\[aq] was a relative path and so concatenated
to \[aq]path\[aq], otherwise returns false.
