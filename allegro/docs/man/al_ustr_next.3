.SH SYNOPSIS

\f[C]
#include\ <allegro5/allegro.h>

bool\ al_ustr_next(const\ ALLEGRO_USTR\ *us,\ int\ *pos)
\f[]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Find the byte offset of the next code point in string, beginning at
\f[C]*pos\f[].
\f[C]*pos\f[] does not have to be at the beginning of a code point.
.PP
Returns true on success, and the value pointed to by \f[C]pos\f[] will
be updated to the found offset.
Otherwise returns false if \f[C]*pos\f[] was already at the end of the
string, and \f[C]*pos\f[] is unmodified.
.PP
This function just looks for an appropriate byte; it doesn\[aq]t check
if found offset is the beginning of a valid code point.
If you are working with possibly invalid UTF\-8 strings then it could
skip over some invalid bytes.
